Aquifer is a command line interface that makes it easy to scaffold, build, test, and deploy your Drupal websites. It is extremely developer-friendly, and will probably save you a lot of time.

## Installation
Aquifer is an npm module, however since it is not ready for production use we have not added it to the npm repository yet, so you cannot use `npm install`. Instead, do the following:

* Ensure that node.js and npm are installed and that your NODE_PATH is set correctly.
* Clone this repository into any directory.
* Within the newly created repo directory, run `npm link`.
* Run `aquifer` in your terminal, and ensure that it returns CLI documentation.
